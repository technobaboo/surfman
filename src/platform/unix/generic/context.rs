/// Represents an OpenGL rendering context.
///
/// A context allows you to issue rendering commands to a surface. When initially created, a
/// context has no attached surface, so rendering commands will fail or be ignored. Typically, you
/// attach a surface to the context before rendering.
///
/// Contexts take ownership of the surfaces attached to them. In order to mutate a surface in any
/// way other than rendering to it (e.g. presenting it to a window, which causes a buffer swap), it
/// must first be detached from its context. Each surface is associated with a single context upon
/// creation and may not be rendered to from any other context. However, you can wrap a surface in
/// a surface texture, which allows the surface to be read from another context.
///
/// OpenGL objects may not be shared across contexts directly, but surface textures effectively
/// allow for sharing of texture data. Contexts are local to a single thread and device.
///
/// A context must be explicitly destroyed with `destroy_context()`, or a panic will occur.
